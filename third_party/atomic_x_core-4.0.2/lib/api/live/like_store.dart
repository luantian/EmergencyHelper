/// Contains the total accumulated like count of the current live room/voice chat room, supporting real-time updates.
///
/// > **Note**: Like count updates automatically. Subscribe to [likeState] to receive real-time updates.
///
/// ### State Properties Overview
///
/// | Property | Type | Description |
/// |--------|------|-----------|
/// | [totalLikeCount] | `ValueListenable<int>` | Total accumulated like count of the current room |

///
/// This listener is used to receive like dynamics in live rooms/voice chat rooms.
///
/// > **Note**: When an audience sends likes, the [onReceiveLikesMessage] callback will be triggered.
///
/// ### Event Description
///
/// | Event | Trigger Condition | Callback Parameters |
/// |------|-----------------|-------------------|
/// | `onReceiveLikesMessage` | Received new like message | liveID, totalLikesReceived, sender |
class LikeListener {
  /// Event callback for receiving new like messages. When other audiences send likes in the live room/voice chat room, this event will be triggered and return relevant information.

  /// - [totalLikesReceived] : Number of new likes received this time
  /// - [sender] : Like sender information

///
/// `LikeStore` Like management class for handling like-related business logic in live rooms/voice chat rooms.
/// `LikeStore` provides a complete set of like management APIs, including sending likes, listening to like events, and getting like states. Through this class, you can implement like interaction features in live rooms.
///
/// ### Key Features
///
/// - **Like Sending**：Support sending likes to the current room
/// - **Like State**：Get the accumulated like count of the current room
/// - **Event Listening**：Listen to like receiving events
///
/// > **Important**: Use the [create] factory method to create a `LikeStore` instance, which requires a valid live room ID.
///
/// > **Note**: Like state updates are delivered through the [likeState] publisher. Subscribe to it to receive real-time updates of like data in the room.
///
/// ### Like Operations Overview
///
/// | Operation | Method | Description |
/// |---------|------|-----------|
/// | Send Like | [sendLike] | Send likes to the current room |
/// | Get State | [likeState] | Get the like state of the current room |
/// | Add Listener | [addLikeListener] | Add like event listener |
/// | Remove Listener | [removeLikeListener] | Remove like event listener |
///
/// ## Topics
///
/// ### Creating Instance
/// - [create] - Create like management instance
///
/// ### Observing State and Events
/// - [likeState] - Like state of the current room
/// - [addLikeListener]/[removeLikeListener] - Like event callbacks
///
/// ### Like Operations
/// - [sendLike] - Send likes
