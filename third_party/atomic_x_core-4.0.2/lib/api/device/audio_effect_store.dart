///
/// Voice changer effects can be applied to human voice, and the voice is processed secondarily through acoustic algorithms to obtain a timbre different from the original sound.
///
/// > **Note**: The set effect will automatically become invalid after leaving the room. If you need the corresponding effect for the next room entry, you need to call the setting interface again.

/// Audio effect related state data provided by AudioEffectStore
///
/// A comprehensive snapshot of the current audio effect session state. This structure contains all relevant information about voice changer effects, reverb effects, and ear monitor state.
///
/// > **Note**: The state is updated automatically when audio effect settings change. Subscribe to [audioEffectState] to receive real-time updates.
/// ### Usage Example
///
/// ```dart
/// // Update voice changer UI
/// store.audioEffectState.audioChangerType.addListener(() {
///     updateChangerTypeUI(store.audioEffectState.audioChangerType.value);
/// });
///
/// // Update reverb UI
/// store.audioEffectState.audioReverbType.addListener(() {
///     updateReverbTypeUI(store.audioEffectState.audioReverbType.value);
/// });
///
/// // Update ear monitor UI
/// store.audioEffectState.isEarMonitorOpened.addListener(() {
///     updateEarMonitorUI(store.audioEffectState.isEarMonitorOpened.value);
/// });
/// ```
///
/// ### State Property Overview
///
/// | Property | Type | Description |
/// |--------|------|-----------|
/// | [audioChangerType] | `ValueListenable<AudioChangerType>` | Current voice changer effect type |
/// | [audioReverbType] | `ValueListenable<AudioReverbType>` | Current reverb effect type |
/// | [isEarMonitorOpened] | `ValueListenable<bool>` | Whether ear monitor is enabled |
/// | [earMonitorVolume] | `ValueListenable<int>` | Ear monitor volume (0-100) |
abstract class AudioEffectState {
  /// Voice changer state.
  ValueListenable<AudioChangerType> get audioChangerType;

  /// Reverb state.
  ValueListenable<AudioReverbType> get audioReverbType;

  /// Ear monitor enabled.
  ValueListenable<bool> get isEarMonitorOpened;

  /// Ear monitor volume, range 0 - 100.
  /// @note If the volume is still too low after setting it to 100, you can set the volume to a maximum of 150, but a volume exceeding 100 may cause distortion, please operate with caution.
  ValueListenable<int> get earMonitorVolume;
}

/// Audio effect setting related interfaces, managing voice changer, reverb, and ear monitor features for anchors.
///
/// `AudioEffectStore` Audio effect management class for handling anchor audio effect related business.
/// `AudioEffectStore` provides a complete set of audio effect management APIs, including voice changer effects, reverb effects, and ear monitor functionality.
/// Through this class, anchors can adjust their voice effects in real-time during live streaming to enhance the experience.
///
/// ### Key Features
///
/// - **Voice Changer Effects**：Supports multiple voice changer effects such as child, little girl, uncle, etc.
/// - **Reverb Effects**：Supports multiple reverb effects such as KTV, small room, auditorium, etc.
/// - **Ear Monitor**：Anchors can hear their own voice in earphones, suitable for singing scenarios
/// - **Volume Control**：Supports fine-grained ear monitor volume adjustment
///
/// > **Important**: Use the [shared] singleton to get the `AudioEffectStore` instance. The set effects will automatically become invalid after leaving the room, and need to be set again for the next room entry.
///
/// > **Note**: Audio effect state updates are delivered through the [audioEffectState] publisher. Subscribe to it to receive real-time updates about voice changer, reverb, and ear monitor states.
///
/// ### Usage Example
///
/// ```dart
/// // Get singleton instance
/// final store = AudioEffectStore.shared;
///
/// // Subscribe to state changes
/// store.audioEffectState.audioChangerType.addListener(() {
///     print("Current voice changer: ${store.audioEffectState.audioChangerType.value}");
/// });
///
/// store.audioEffectState.audioReverbType.addListener(() {
///     print("Current reverb: ${store.audioEffectState.audioReverbType.value}");
/// });
///
/// // Set voice changer effect
/// store.setAudioChangerType(AudioChangerType.littleGirl);
///
/// // Set reverb effect
/// store.setAudioReverbType(AudioReverbType.ktv);
///
/// // Enable ear monitor
/// store.setVoiceEarMonitorEnable(true);
/// store.setVoiceEarMonitorVolume(80);
/// ```
